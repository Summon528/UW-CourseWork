# Homework 6

- The 4 points I chose are [570 71; 643 617; 534 265; 218 306]
- See demo.gif where I demonstrate clicking those points. (or demo.mp4 for better quality)
- The current code will show an animation of refocusing those points
- To switch back to ginput mode, set `mode = 0` in `refocusApp.m`
