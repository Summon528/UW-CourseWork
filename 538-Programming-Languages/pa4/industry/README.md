# Industry Path

## Motivation

The first step towards entering "the industry" is often a series of bogus
datastructures and algorithm questions that test you on your ability to 
regurgitate largely useless trivia. These questions are the key indicator
to large tech companies that you can fall in line like a node on a well 
designed red-black tree. Regardless of your opinion on the tests, doing well
in an interview can be the difference between being ghosted, offered 80k, or
offered 160k for your first position out of college.

Since these tests are standardized and well known, sites like LeetCode,
HackerRank and CodeWars (among others) have been created to help new graduates
prepare for the inevitable. 

## Setup

If you do not already have one, create a free account on LeetCode.com.

## Task

If you take the industry path, your assignment will be to complete 6 LeetCode 
style problems. The 6 problems should be comprised of 2 easy, 2 medium, and 
2 hard challenges. Each problem must be completed in a different language. 
Additionally, there are the following language requirements:

* Easy: The easy problems must be completed in a language you have *never* written in before.
* Medium: At least one of the medium problems must be completed in a functional language.
* Hard: At least one of the hard problems must be completed in a functional language.

## Notes:

Your solutions do not have to be optimal runtime, but try for close-to-optimal.
If the solution should be O(log(n)), don't submit a solution that is O(n^3).

You may choose any of the problems on leetcode so long as they fit with the 
difficulty requirements above.

## Honor code

I recognize that many of you have worked on leetcode before, please do not use
problems you have previously solved.

I also recognize that the solutions to these problems are generally freely available
online. Please do not copy paste solution code. 

## Bonus

Do a hard problem in a language you haven't used before.

## Submission

First create an empty file `INDUSTRY.md`. This file is used to tell the autograder you are using the 
industry path.

To submit, you will generate a micro-writeup for each problem.

The writeup should be a markdown file named: `<difficulty>.<problem_number>.md`

The writeup should contain:
1. The name of the problem
2. The language used
3. The experience of using this language to solve the problem

Also submit the code for the problem using the name: `<difficulty>.<problem_number>.<ext>`

Finally, submit a screenshot of LeetCode accepting (or showing complexity-only issues) your code.
