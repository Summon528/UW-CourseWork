# Rust Calculator Points

## Parser (15 points)
+ 10: `evaluate_line` 
+ 5: Propagates errors correctly (doesn't drop error)

## Stack (35 points)

+ 20: `eval`
+ 5: Propagates errors correctly (doesn't drop error)

# Deductions
Per point, but do not double-penalize for cascading errors.

- 10%: Minor error (missed edge case, failing test or two)
- 30%: Medium error (missed class of inputs, more than a few failing tests)
- 50%: Major error (code mostly does not work, almost all tests failing, but with some reasonable tries)

- 2: warnings in correct code (per problem)
- 2: unexpected panics (per problem)

Do not penalize:
* Clippy lints
* Warnings in broken code
